# Sleep-Impulsivity Research Proposal
## Background
Adolescence is a crucial developmental period involving emotional and behavioral regulation. Defined as the period of time between 10 and 24 years of age, adolescence spans the transition from childhood to adulthood, bookended by the start of puberty and roughly the end of major neurocognitive development (Sawyer 2018).1 As a whole, this era in one's life contains significant physical and emotional turmoil. 
Sleep is an especially important aspect of this developmental process, with less sleep being linked with decreased cognitive performance and emotional regulation with associated structural effects (Galvan 2020).2 Despite the importance of adequate sleep, American adolescents tend to get significantly less sleep than recommended (Paruthi 2016).3 Furthermore, sleep duration is generally lower in the adolescent period compared to both children and early adults (Maslowsky 2014).4
The importance of sleep for impulse control is well documented (Grant 2018).5 While adolescence generally is a period of increased risk-taking behavior as one explores the boundaries of freedom in a rapidly evolving social role, poor sleep is specifically involved in behavior dysregulation including poor impulse control (Lollies 2022).6 In the opposite direction, impulsivity has been shown to increase insomnia severity (Schmidt 2010).7
It makes sense, then, that the reciprocal relationship between impulsive behavior in response to negative affect and sleep difficulty has also been demonstrated, and that the relationship holds over time (Bauducco 2019).8 This bidirectional relationship points towards a negative cycle in which poor impulse control worsens sleep problem while, at the same time, worsened sleep exacerbates or complements impulsivity.
However, to my knowledge, no study has looked at the longitudinal, bidirectional association between the multiple dimensions of impulsivity and sleep problems. In this study, I intend to utilize the ABCD Study® dataset to examine this relationship over five years. 

## Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1: Negative and positive urgency and lack of perseverance are two facets of impulsivity that will be negatively affected by sleep over time
Hypothesis 2: Sleep initiation will be primarily affected by impulsive behavior

## Specific Aim
To determine whether there is a bidirectional association between impulsive behavior and sleep health in adolescents. 

## Methods
Data:
This study will use data from the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study®. A more detailed overview of the study can be found on the study website and in various publications. In summary, the data are collected from 21 sites around the United States, including over 11,000 children recruited between ages 9-10 with an annual follow-up for at least 10 years. This study will use the 5.1 data release (unless 6.0 gets released soon), which includes 7 follow-up timepoints (baseline, 6-month, 1-year, 18-month, 2-year, 30-month, and 3-year follow-up) (Garavan 2018).9 In this study, participants without sleep disturbance or impulsivity measures will be excluded. 
Analysis: 
In the first part of the analytic approach, the five metrics of the UPPS-P will be entered into Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models (RI-CLPMs) along with the Difficulty Initiating and Maintaining Sleep (DIMS) scale, which includes sleep duration. These models will allow us to examine the significance of the bidirectional relationship between sleep difficulty and the five facets of impulsivity: negative urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking, and positive urgency (Cyders 2014).10 The Random-Intercept variant of the Cross-Lagged Panel Model was chosen based off of prior literature suggesting that CLPMs do not adequately delineate within-person and between-person variance (Hawes 2015 4; Hamaker et al., 2015).11,12 RI-CLPMs have been explicitly suggested for use with the ABCD Study® data as a way of more appropriately capturing variance that may occur within an individual over time or between two people at a given time point. 
In the second part of the analysis, we will break down the broader category of sleep difficulty and explore the associations with only the significant facets of impulsivity determined in the first part (hypothesized to be positive/negative urgency and lack of perseverance). The DIMS scale will be separated into three categories: sleep duration, difficulty initiating sleep, and difficulty maintaining sleep. These measures will be inputted as nodes into a network analysis, in which the strength of the association between each node will be estimated. This allows us to determine the underlying relationship between these variables. Specifically, we will look at the strength of association between components of sleep difficulty and impulsivity factors affected by sleep difficulty broadly defined. These contemporaneous networks will be complemented by temporal networks that track the development of these trends over time. 

## Expected Results and Limitations
Results:
First, I expect to find a reciprocal, longitudinal association between urgency and lack of perseverance that increases over time. This finding will demonstrate the hypothesized negative cycle of sleep problems and impulsive behavior. Second, I expect to find that sleep initiation and sleep duration will be strongly associated with the relevant facets of impulsivity, namely urgency and lack of perseverance. 
Limitations:
There are several notable study limitations. First, that the sleep metrics are self-reported by parents. Future studies may improve in this aspect by directly, objectively observing sleep behavior. Second, although potential sociodemographic covariates were included, external factors like significant life events that may have an effect on the temporal progression of observed metrics were not considered. Third, the impulsivity examined in this study represents only one facet of a complex, multifactorial construct. The five facets of impulsivity defined in the UPPS-P test look at impulsive behavior as a personality trait (Whiteside 2001, Mestre-Bach 2020, MacKillop 2016). 13–15
